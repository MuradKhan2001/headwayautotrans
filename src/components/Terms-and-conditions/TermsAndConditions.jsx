                        </strong>Headway Auto Transport mainly offers two
                            types of service for shipping vehicles. The services
                            are the Economy Saver Rate (ESR) and Guaranteed
                            First Class Rate (FCR). Below are detailed
                            explanations of each category.</p>

                                Rate. </strong>Economy Saver Rate (ESR): ESR is
                            a SAVINGS shipping option where Headway Auto
                            Transport will make every possible effort to find a
                            Carrier to ship vehicle at the estimated rate
                            approximately but not guaranteed within seven (7)
                            full workdays after the Vehicle Availability Date
                            (VAD) for pickup. However, Customer understands and
                            agrees that this option is a discounted rate whereby
                            Headway Auto Transport negotiates with carriers to
                            accept vehicles. Chances of acceptance by carriers
                            at this rate may range from 5% to 30% depending on
                            any number of factors such as prevailing economic
                            conditions and the time of the year. Usually Headway
                            Auto Transport’s initial quotes fall into this
                            category and if a customer wants to upgrade a
                            responsible agent needs to be notified to give a
                            guaranteed rate.</p>
                        <p className="MsoNormal">Headway Auto Transport will
                            incrementally increase the price if no carrier show
                            interest for lower price, but customer may accept or
                            decline offers of the carriers for higher prices. It
                            is important to note that timelines specified are
                            NOT absolute, and are subject to normal weather
                            conditions, and normal operations of Carrier. If
                            Headway Auto Transport is unable to secure a Carrier
                            within estimated time for estimated amount, and
                            Customer is unwilling to increase the price, Headway
                            Auto Transport reserves the right to cancel order,
                            without further liability on part of Headway Auto

                            the first day vehicle is available for pick up.
                            Headway Auto Transport will compensate carrier
                            should an increase in price occur. If a vehicle is

                            Headway Auto Transport will incrementally increase
                            the carrier payment, but such increase will not
